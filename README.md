# Project: Investigate a Dataset - No-Show Appointments

### Overview

This repository contains my first project from the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

In this project, I explored key steps of the Data Analytics Process using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The goal was to analyze and uncover insights from the "Medical Appointment No-Shows" dataset.

### Steps Performed

* 1. Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, inconsistencies, and formatted data for analysis.

* 2. Data Wrangling: Organized and prepared the dataset into a usable format by restructuring and transforming data.

* 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated patterns, distributions, and relationships among variables.

* 4. Data Modeling and Analysis: Applied statistical techniques to identify factors related to no-show appointments.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle: Medical Appointment No-Shows.

#### Key Information:

* Total Records: 110,527 medical appointments.

* Variables: 14 features describing patient and appointment characteristics, including:

* Patient ID, Appointment ID, Gender

* Scheduled Date, Appointment Date

* Age, Neighbourhood

* Scholarship (indicates participation in Bolsa Fam√≠lia welfare program)

* Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism

* Handicap, SMS_received

* No-show (target variable indicating if a patient missed the appointment)

### Tools Used

#### Python Libraries:

* Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

* NumPy: Numerical computations.

* Matplotlib: Data visualization.

### Objective

The primary goal was to investigate and answer the following:

* What factors influence whether a patient shows up for their medical appointment?

* Are there any patterns or trends in the no-show data?
